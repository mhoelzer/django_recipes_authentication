# Django Recipebox: Forms!

Welcome to forms in Django!

There's a lot of fun to be had with forms, and thankfully Django takes a lot of the pain and agony away when trying to get data into our application. The video that we took this morning is below, and you can find documentation for what we covered here: [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/forms/#building-a-form-in-django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/forms/#building-a-form-in-django)

Now it's time to put this into practice.

Make two new html pages for our recipe application: one to add recipes, and one to add authors. Make two form models (contained within forms.py) that we can serve and take in data from.

If you want and if you have the time, I recommend taking the rest of today to throw in some html / CSS and see how that influences your application. If you want to read more about serving static resources, the /static folder may be of some use to you. [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/howto/static-files/](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/howto/static-files/)
